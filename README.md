This project constitutes the Module 4 Challenge for the Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp.

## Overview of the School District Analysis

### Purpose

This analysis was performed to help Maria determine performance of all the schools in a district across reading and math assessments. In particular, there were a number of specific analyses Maria requested: An overall district summary, top and bottom performing schools, grade-level analyses, results by school spending, results by school size, and results by school type. Further complicating matters, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders may have been altered. As such, two separate analyses were performed, with and without Thomas freshmen.

### Challenges to the Analysis

There was the aforementioned anomaly for the Thomas 9th graders that required an entire second set of analyses. In addition, data cleaning had to be performed as student name data contained unnecessary prefixes and suffixes that had to be removed.

## Results

### Differeces in metrics due to Thomas data

- School Summary

First of all, no data was more affected that the data for Thomas High School itself. See [the data with ninth grade included](https://github.com/josephrodini/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Thomas_Original.PNG) and [the data with ninth grade excluded](https://github.com/josephrodini/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Thomas_Updated.PNG). The percentages went from under 70% to over 90%. The anomalous data was really dragging the school's performance down.
